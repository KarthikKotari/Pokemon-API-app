This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Introduction

A single page application displaying data from a Pokemon API using Nextjs, Typrescript and Graphql

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## External API's

1. Apollo Client : Used apollo client as a state management library to manage Graphql. It is initialised in graphql/apollo.tsx file. We are creating a component and using it to wrap the application in \_app.tsx .

2. GraphQl code generator : It is a tool that can generate typescript types and code from the Graphql Endpoint using the graphql schema (graphql/posts/getpokemons.graphql). Once configured, it generates all the typescript types and hooks in generated.tsx. It generates hooks as well which in this case is useGetPokemonsQuery.

# codegen.yml : contains the configuration for the Graphql code generator

# generated.tsx : contains the types and hooks generated by Graphql code generator

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
